For successful transactions, the parameters specified in the call 
trxuser_id trx_amount, trx_currency, trx_user_comment and address data of
your customers repeated in the result parameters.

Silent mode allows you ipayment invisibly integrate into your shop.
While the ordering process, the payment information is transmitted
directly to ipayment and there processed processed without any of
ipayment is a visible issue for your customers. You can a form for
recording the data to create maps, the layout perfect for your online
Shops fits. The feedback (result or error) will also be on a separate
Page displayed in your shop. This leaves your customer during the
order process never noticeably your shop. ipayment is on silent mode
relatively easy to integrate into your web application. Ver- apply to
the parameters redirect_url (success message) or silent_error_url
(Error message). Both URLs have CGI scripts to be in your store,
which-due to the overweight surrounded parameters can perform
appropriate actions. Such actions are to His example by storing the
order or the issue of the error message. Prevent manipulation of
payment data In addition to the payment data in silent mode when
calling the ipayment Basic data (for example your ipayment account
data) and other fixed-Pa parameters (for example, amount, and currency
settings) transferred. These values can be viewed by the purchaser and
also manipulated. No problem, it is, if after a successful payment,
the correctness of these values ​​is checked. If you want to prevent
these parameters from the buyer be viewed or manipulated may be, you
can transfer the information to advance ipayment and a session at
ipayment Pre-Generate. After that, transfer the call, only the ID of
the session. Exactly how it works, refer to the chapter Pre-Generate
session IDs on page 42 read. Ipayment the server uses a 256-bit SSL
certificate. Thereby, the security of data Payment information to
ensure the processing on the server ipayment. So safety can be ensured
even at the entry and transmission of data, SSL on your pages must
also be present. If you do not use SSL, it can happen that some
browsers when it returns from the SSL-secured ipayment server in your
Web warnings. In addition, we strongly recommend that you use a
special "Hidden Trigger Script" to obtain feedback from successful
transactions secure. For more information mation on this process, see
Secured feedback successful transaction tions on page 41 When silent
mode you can use 3-D Secure for "Verified by Visa", "MasterCard
SecureCode" and use "Maestro SecureCode" without further changes are
needed. 3-D Secure is in silent mode automatically available. A
separate PCI certification is also not necessary, since the payment
data solely on the server does ipayment be working. Example of
application In our FAQ you will find an example script for integrating
ipayment in "Silent mode ": http://faq.ipayment.de> questions
