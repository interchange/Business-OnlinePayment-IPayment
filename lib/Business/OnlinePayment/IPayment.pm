our $VERSION = '0.05';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an interface for online payments via gateway, using the
IPayment silent mode (L<https://ipayment.de>).

It supports payments, capture reverse operations, and vault-related
functions.

=head2 ACCESSORS

=head3 Fixed values (accountData and processorUrls)

The following attributes should and can be set only in the
constructor, as they are pretty much fixed values.

=over 4

=item wsdl_file

The name of th WSDL file. It should be a local file.

=cut

has wsdl_file => (is => 'rw');

=item accountid

The Ipayment account id (the one put into the CGI url). Integer.

=cut

has accountid => (is => 'rw',
                  isa => sub {
                      die "Not an integer" unless $_[0] =~ m/^[0-9]+$/s
                  });

=item trxuserid

The application ID, you can in your ipayment configuration menu read
using  Anwendung > Details. Integer

=cut

has trxuserid => (is => 'rw',
                  isa => sub {
                      die "Not an integer" unless $_[0] =~ m/^[0-9]+$/s
                  });

=item trxpassword

For each application, there is an application password which
automatically ipayment System is presented. The password consists of
numbers. You will find the application password in your ipayment
Anwendungen > Details

B<This is not the account password!>

=cut

has trxpassword => (is => 'rw');

=item adminactionpassword

The admin password.

B<This is not the account password!>

=cut 

has adminactionpassword => (is => 'rw');


=item app_security_key

If this attribute is set, we will (and shall) send a checksum for the
parameters.

B<Without this, we are opened to tampering>

=cut

has app_security_key => (is => 'rw');


=item accountData

Accessor to retrieve the hash with the account data details. The
output will look like this:

 accountData => {
                 accountid => 99999,
                 trxuserid => 99999,
                 trxpassword =>0,
                 adminactionpassword => '5cfgRT34xsdedtFLdfHxj7tfwx24fe'}


=cut

sub accountData {
    my $self = shift;
    my %account_data = (  # mandatory
                        accountId => $self->accountid,
                        trxuserId => $self->trxuserid,
                        trxpassword => $self->trxpassword
                        );
    my $adminpass = $self->adminactionpassword;
    if (defined $adminpass) {
        $account_data{adminactionpassword} = $adminpass;
    }
    return \%account_data;
}

=item success_url 

Mandatory (for us) field, where to redirect the user in case of success.

CGI-Name: C<redirect_url>

I<In silent mode, the parameters are always passed by GET to the
script.> (no need to C<redirect_action>)

=cut

has success_url => (is => 'rw',
                    isa => sub { die "Missing success url" unless $_[0] },
                    default => sub { die "Missing success url" },
                   );

=item failure_url

Mandatory (for us) field, where to redirect the user in case of failure.

CGI Name: C<silent_error_url>
Data type: String

This URL is more in case of failure of ipayment system with the error information and parameters B<using the GET method>. This URL must point to a CGI script that can handle the paramaters.

=cut

has failure_url => (is => 'rw',
                    isa => sub { die "Missing failure url" unless $_[0] },
                    default => sub { die "Missing success url" },
                   );


=item hidden_trigger_url

Optional url for the hidden trigger.

=cut

has hidden_trigger_url => (is => 'rw');


=item processorUrls

Return the hashref with the defined urls

=back

=cut

sub processorUrls {
    my $self = shift;
    return {
            redirectUrl => $self->success_url,
            silentErrorUrl => $self->failure_url,
            hiddenTriggerUrl => $self->hidden_trigger_url
           };
}





=head3 error

This accessors point to a XML::Compile::SOAP backtrace. The object is
quite large and deeply nested, but it's there just in case we need it.

=cut

has error => (is => 'rwp');

=head3 debug

Every call to session id stores the trace into this attribute.

=cut

has debug => (is => 'rwp');

=head3 trx_obj

Attribute to hold a L<Business::OnlinePayment::IPayment::Transaction> object

=cut

has trx_obj => (is => 'rwp');

=head3 transaction

Constructor for the object above. All the argument are passed verbatim
to the L<Business::OnlinePayment::IPayment::Transaction> constructor,
then the object is stored.

=cut

sub transaction {
    my $self = shift;
    my %trx = @_;
    my $trxdata = Business::OnlinePayment::IPayment::Transaction->new(%trx);
    $self->_set_trx_obj($trxdata);
}


=head2 METHODS

=over 4

=item session_id

This is the main method to call. The session is not stored in the object, because it can used only B<once>. So calling session_id will send the data to the SOAP service and retrieve the session key.

=cut

sub session_id {
    my $self = shift;
    # clean eventually stale data
    $self->_set_error(undef);

    my %args = (
                # fixed values
                accountData => $self->accountData,
                processorUrls => $self->processorUrls,
                # then the transaction
                transactionType => $self->trx_obj->transactionType,
                paymentType => $self->trx_obj->paymentType,
                transactionData => $self->trx_obj->transactionData,
               );
    # and the options, if needed
    if ($self->trx_obj->options) {
        $args{options} = $self->trx_obj->options;
    }

    # do the request passing the accountData
    my ($res, $trace) = $self->_get_soap_object('createSession')->(%args);
    $self->_set_debug($trace);

    # check if we got something valuable
    unless ($res and
            ref($res) eq 'HASH' and 
            exists $res->{createSessionResponse}->{sessionId}) {
        # ok, we got an error. Save the trace to the error and return
        $self->_set_error($trace);
        return undef;
    }

    return $res->{createSessionResponse}->{sessionId};
    # please note that we don't store the sessionId. It's a fire and forget.
}


=item raw_response_hash

Debug for the arguments passed to IPayment::Return;

=cut

has raw_response_hash => (is => 'rwp');



=item capture($ret_trx_number, $amount, $currency, $opts)

Charge an amount previously preauth'ed. C<$amount> and C<$currency>
are optional and may be used to charge partial amounts. C<$amount> and
C<$currency> follow the same rules of C<trxAmount> and C<trxCurrency>
of L<Business::OnlinePayment::IPayment::Transaction> (no decimal,
usually multiply by 100).

The last optional argument should be a hashref with additional
parameters to pass to transactionData (notably shopperId).

=cut

sub _do_post_payment_op {
    my ($self, $op, $number, $amount, $currency, $trxdetails) = @_;
    unless (defined $number) {
        $self->_set_error("Missing transaction number");
        return undef;

    else {
        $self->_set_error($trace);
        return undef;
    }
}

=item datastorage_op($datastorage_id)

After calling C<transaction>, if you have a valid datastorage id, you
may want to use that instead of creating a session and use the form.

This method will do a SOAP request to the Ipayment server, using the
transaction details provided in the call to C<transaction>, and do the
requested operation. So far it's supported preauth and auth. The
capture and other operations should be done via its own method (which
don't require the datastorage, but simply the previous transaction's
id).

=cut

sub datastorage_op {
    my ($self, $id) = @_;
    return unless $id;
    
    $self->_set_error(undef);
    # this should be fully populated by now
    my %args = (
                accountData => $self->accountData,
                paymentData => {
                                storageData => {
                                                fromDatastorageId => $id,
                                               },
                               },
                transactionData => $self->trx_obj->transactionData,
               );
    my $operation = $self->trx_obj->transactionType;
    # append the options if needed

    # need the SOAP one
    my $op = $self->_translate_to_soap_call($operation);

    }
    else {
        $self->_set_error($trace);
        return undef;
    }
}

=item expire_datastorage($id)

Given the storage id passed as argument, expire it. Keep in mind that
expiring it multiple times returns always true, so the return code is
not really interesting.

It returns 0 if the storage didn't exist.

=cut

sub expire_datastorage {
    my ($self, $id) = @_;
    return unless $id;
    my $op = 'expireDatastorage';

                                      $amount, $currency, $opts);
}

=item reverse($ret_trx_number)

Release the amount previously preauth'ed, passing the original
transaction number. No partial amount can be released, and will
succeed only if no charging has been done.

=cut


sub reverse {
    my ($self, $number) = @_;
    # we don't pass $amount and $currency
    return $self->_do_post_payment_op(reverse => $number);
}

=item refund($ret_trx_number, $amount, $currency, $opts)

Refund the given amount. Please note that we have to pass the
transaction number B<of the capture>, not the C<preauth> one.

The last optional argument should be a hashref with additional
parameters to pass to transactionData (notably shopperId).

=cut

values of this class.

=head3 ipayment_cgi_location

Returns the correct url where the customer posts the CC data, which is simply:
L<https://ipayment.de/merchant/<Account-ID>/processor/2.0/>

=cut

    my $self = shift;

      . '/processor/2.0/';
}


=head2 Additional information

=head3 country

Country code of the cardholder of the current
L<Business::OnlinePayment::IPayment::Transaction> object

Being these information transaction specific, if a transaction has not
been initiated, the method will not do anything nor will return
anything.

UK will be translated to GB, and EI to IE.

sub country {
    my $self = shift;
    # 
    return unless $self->trx_obj;
    if (@_ == 1) {
        $self->trx_obj->addr_info->{country} = shift;
    }
    my $country = uc($self->trx_obj->addr_info->{country});
    return unless $country =~ m/^[A-Z]{2,3}$/s;
